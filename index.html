                <p>Hey! I'm Mandeep, a curious individual with an insatiable appetite for crafting digital wonders. Developing innovative solutions is where I find my true passion. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the world on a morning run, nurturing my beloved plants, or strolling along the streets, soaking in the charm of the world. I find solace in witnessing the beauty of sunsets, losing myself in the melodies of music, and immersing in captivating stories through reading. Feel free to join me on this journey of creation and exploration.</p>

                <h3>Reading</h3>
               <p>Books serve as my sanctuary, nurturing my imagination through Agatha Christie's intricate mysteries and the enchanting tales of Harry Potter's magical world. In 'On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous' and 'The Bell Jar', I explore profound insights into the complexities of human existence. From the pages of classic literature to contemporary works, allowing me to traverse diverse landscapes of emotions and ideas. The written word is not just a source of knowledge but a boundless realm where I find solace, inspiration, and a deeper understanding of the human spirit.</p>

                <h3>Running</h3>
                <p>Running is an enduring passion, intricately woven into the fabric of my life. From excelling as a state athlete in high school to clinching 17th place at the Pride and Remembrance run in Toronto, running epitomizes my journey of personal triumph. The vibrant "Queer run club" in Toronto connects me with fellow queer runners, whose inspirations fuel my aspirations. Geared for the Niagara half marathon this September, I'm determined to conquer a full marathon by year-end. Here is he link to my Strava profile where you can connect with me!! Let's hit those trails.</p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Embarking on a soul-enriching odyssey, I wholeheartedly embrace the symphony of alternate and folk etc. The essence of audacious artists who intertwine boldness and significance resonates deeply, from Amy Winehouse's soulful rhythms to Hozier's ethereal melodies. Billie Eilish's rebellious spirit and Taylor Swift's narrative prowess inspire me. My playlist encompasses Ali Sethi's soulful renditions, captivating ghazals, and the vibrant rhythms of Bollywood. Connecting with fellow swifties at Era's Toronto tour would be a delightful melody! Here is the spotify link.</p>
